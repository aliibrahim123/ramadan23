Indeed you got angry for the sake of Allah so have hope in the One whom you got angry forIndeed the people feared you in the matter of their world while you feared them for your faithThen leave to them that for which they are afraid of you and get away from them with that which you feared them forHow needy they are for that which you dissuade them from and how needless you are of that which they deny youEven if the skies and the earth were closed to an individual and [then] he feared Allah, Allah would most certainly open a way for him in themSo let nothing give you comfort but the truth and let nothing distress you except falsehoodIf you would have accepted their world [and its attractions] they would have loved you, and if you had shared in it they would have given you asylum","Qsm":"1","Bab":"5","Fsl":"37","Topic":"183","Source":"1","fav":0,"lastcheckdate":""}]
